## ** SP-TFF has been tested using several operating systems (Macintosh, Unix, and PC), and it should run on all platforms that support MATLAB. 

I will constantly update this repo to make them easier to use and understand.

## Brief Introduction:
SP-TFF code package aims to present a methodology for high-resolution polarization analysis and filtering of seismic signals in the TF-domain. The main developments in this research work are: (a) reformulation of the eigenvalue decomposition polarization analysis (EDPA) in  TF-domain, (b) combining the SP-TFR to the formulation to obtain high-resolution TF-domains polarization parameters for discriminating nearby seismic phases, and (c)  incorporating TF-domain directivity, rectilinearity, and amplitude attributes to extract (or eliminate) different seismic phases. The main focus is to discriminate between Love and Rayleigh from the body and coda waves.

## Contents of this repo
1. The synthetic and real example of the "Sparsity-promoting approach to polarization analysis of seismic signals in the time-frequency domain" are reproducible.

2. A fast and efficient code for sparsity-promoting time-frequency representation (SP-TFR) is presented.

## Running the synthetic and real examples
Run POL_Synthetic_main.m and POL_Real_main.m codes

## Advantages of this work
SP-TFF is a method for separating not only the Rayleigh waves from the Love waves, but also in discriminating them from the body and coda waves.
