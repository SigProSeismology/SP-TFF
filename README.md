# SP-TFF
This code package aims to present a methodology for high-resolution polarization analysis and filtering of seismic signals in the TF-domain. The main developments in this research work are: (a) reformulation of the eigenvalue decomposition polarization analysis (EDPA) in  TF-domain to alleviate the intrinsic shortcoming of \citet{pinnegar2006polarization} method analyzing linear particle motions, (b) combining the \ac{SP-TFR} to the formulation to obtain high-resolution TF-domains polarization parameters for discriminating nearby seismic phases, and (c)  incorporating \ac{TF}-domain directivity, rectilinearity, and amplitude attributes to extract (or eliminate) different seismic phases. The main focus is to discriminate between Love and Rayleigh from the body and coda waves.
