# SP-TFF
This code package aims to present a methodology for high-resolution polarization analysis and filtering of seismic signals in the TF-domain. The main developments in this research work are: (a) reformulation of the eigenvalue decomposition polarization analysis (EDPA) in  TF-domain, (b) combining the SP-TFR to the formulation to obtain high-resolution TF-domains polarization parameters for discriminating nearby seismic phases, and (c)  incorporating TF-domain directivity, rectilinearity, and amplitude attributes to extract (or eliminate) different seismic phases. The main focus is to discriminate between Love and Rayleigh from the body and coda waves.

The source codes represents the methodology presented in the Sparsity-promoting approach to polarization analysis
of seismic signals in the time-frequency domain paper published in the IEEE transacton in Geoscience and Remote sensing Journal.
